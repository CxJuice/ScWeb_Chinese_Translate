For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.": "戈特利布·约姆曾是职业圈最顶尖的赛手，他不惜一切代价来蝴获得更好的成绩，哪怕每圈只快那么几秒。有一小段时间，在安全委员会介入之前，他甚至不穿衣服上赛道，并坚称衣服的重量也会成为累赘。另一件知名事情还有他曾认为他的赛船护盾过于强大了，而他只需要挡住几下攻击即可，因为他觉得可以靠机动脱离射程否则的话也不用继续比赛了。约姆手动拆除了护盾，并重新装了一个轻型护盾，以此为飞船提供更多的动力代价则是护盾保护他的能力大幅缩小。过了不久，其他赛手也仿照他来改装自己的护盾，而约姆也开始出售自己品牌的护盾并走向成功。",
